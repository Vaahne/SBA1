        <h3>Title</h3>
        <p> Choose a clear title that tells the cook what to expect and includes search-friendly words. "Andouille and Chicken Creole Pasta" tells us more about the dish than "Mardi Gras Pasta." Since other cooks often search by ingredient, "Andouille and Chicken Creole Pasta" is more likely to pop up.</p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Include a short but detailed sentence describing the dish that will get the cook excited and tell them what to expect. Check out AppleChef's description for Pan-Seared Tilapia for example:</p>
        <p>"This pan-seared tilapia dish is a delicious and easy way to prepare seafood! Great for a quick weeknight meal accompanied with fresh veggies. Try this healthy dish full of flavor and nutrition!"</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>Include measurments</p>
        <p>List ingredients in order</p>
        <p>Include ingredient prep</p>
