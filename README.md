# Recipe Website  
A simple recipe website that allows users to **add new recipes** and **view existing recipes**.  

## Features  
- Users can log in via the **Login Form** (Click on the login icon in the top-right navbar).  
- Users can add a new recipe via the **"Add a Recipe"** form (Located under **About Us -> Add a Recipe**).  

## Future Enhancements  
If more time were available, I would:  
- Implement a **card-style layout** to display recipes in an organized manner on the homepage.  
- Add a **chat feature** in future projects for real-time assistance.  

## Challenges Faced  
- Debugging **navbar issues** when using `position: fixed`.  
- Special thanks to our **instructor** for guidance in resolving the issue.  

## References  
- Reviewed **Bootstrap documentation** .  
- Practiced and tested concepts using **W3Schools**.  
- Used **Google, ChatGPT, and YouTube** for additional clarifications.
